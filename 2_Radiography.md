## Radiography (X-Ray Imaging)

### Basic Principle

We have an X-Ray tube that "shoots out" radiation (photons in a very specific frequency range). The wavelength is extremely short, way shorter than the wavelength of visible light.

X-Rays touch and interact with the human body / tissue ("Gewebe"). Some of the x-rays then get absorbed (bad!) while others travel through (with reduced intensity).  
The x-ray image itself shows the amount of attenuation ("AbschwÃ¤chung") of the initial x-ray beam(s). Since different types of tissues (bone, air, etc.) have different attenuation coefficients, we can use the attenation of the signal to conclude what type of material we are dealing with.

**Visual appearance**  
Less dense tissue (e.g. air) --> Less attenuation --> darker appearance  
**Therefore air is black!** See long CT where a major part of the image is black.

### Problem with Radiography

We cannot differentiate between soft tissue.  

**What about Mammography, isn't it X-ray based too?**  
In breast imaging we only have soft tissue. But the higher the energy of your X-ray is, the less we are able differentiate between different tissue types. Therefore, we use low energy beams for mammography. Unfortunately, this has the affect that more radiation is absorbed by the tissue as well. This is obviously bad!

**Note:** X-Ray technology is cheap compared to other approaches.


### Sketch of the working principle

**Note:** The filament is typically made of tungsten ("Wolfram")

**Process description:**

1. Apply voltage to the system
2. Atoms start to vibrate + electrons start to move. This causes the wire (filament) to heat up.
3. At some point the electrons will have so much cinetic energy that they "jump out" of filament and move towards the anode
4. Electrons start to travel towards the anode due to the potential difference
5. Radiation gets produced as soon as the electrons hit the material

### How do x-ray photons get generated?

We now understand the basic working principle of the x-ray scanner and how it makes electrons travelling towards the anode. However, no x-ray beams have been generated yet.  
So the question that remains is obviously where exactly the x-ray beams come from.

To understand this we need to take a closer look at the anode hit by the electrons.  
Once the electron hits the material it gets slowed / completely stopped by the forces of any atom it encounters. If the electron is slowed down, it will exit the material with less energy. This is what is called **"Bremsstrahlung"**.  
However, the law of conservation of energy tells us that energy cannot be lost and must be absorbed by the atom or converted to another for of energy.  The energy used to slow the electron is excessive to the atom and the energy will be radiated as x-radiation of equal energy.

**If the electron is completely stopped by the strong positive force of the nucleus, the radiated x-ray energy will have an energy equal to the total kinetic energy of the electron.**

**Note:** To get the maximum numer of x-ray photons, the electrons need to travel very close to the atoms. So converting ALL electrons into x-rays is unlikely.

However, the "Bremsstrahlung" is not the only way how x-ray photons get generated!  
Another type of radiation is called **characteristic radiation**. Therefore, let's take a closer look at the atoms and its shells.

Once the electron hits the atom, it might eject an electron from one of the shells. So, it hits the electron and the electron gets removed from the shell. What remains is a vacancy (free spot) in the shell. At this point the atom is also called "ionized". Now an electron from the outer shell falls into the inner shell. This again produces x-ray photons.

The amount of energy that gets generated is heavily dependent on the material (tungsten, etc.) and the initial energy level.

We can now plot an intensity diagram which will look as follows:

**Note:**  
- Smooth part: Caused by "Bremsstrahlung"  
- Peaks: Caused by characteristic x-ray


### Example:

Let's compute the wavelength of an x-ray photon with 60keV.

1. Compute energy of the photon  
   $E = 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19} \cdot 60000 = 9.6 \cdot 10^{-15} \frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s^2}$
2. We know that E = hf where h is the Planck constant  
   $h = 6.626 \cdot 10^{-34} \frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s}$  
   $f = \frac{E}{h} = 1.44 \cdot 10^{19} Hz$
3. Let's compute the wavelength  
   $f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = 0.02 nm$
   
**Note:** This is significantly smaller than visible light (400nm - 700nm). That's also why x-rax penetrates the human body and visibly light does not.

### Interactions with the human tissue

We now understand how the x-ray photons get generated. What remains is the question how we can use x-ray to obtain an image of a patient.  
Therefore, let's imagine that the x-ray photons arrive at the human tissue with a specific intensity value ($I_{0}$). Once, the photons travel through the tissue they get attenuated. The amount of **attenuation** is **dependent on the tissue type** and the **material thickness**.

$I = I_{0} \cdot e^{-\mu \cdot t}$  

$\mu$ ... Attenuation coefficient  
$t$ ... material thickness
