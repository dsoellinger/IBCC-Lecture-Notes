## Radiography (X-Ray Imaging)

### Basic Principle

We have an X-Ray tube that "shoots out" radiation (photons in a very specific frequency range). The wavelength is extremely short, way shorter than the wavelength of visible light.

X-Rays touch and interact with the human body / tissue ("Gewebe"). Some of the x-rays then get absorbed (bad!) while others travel through (with reduced intensity).  
The x-ray image itself shows the amount of attenuation ("AbschwÃ¤chung") of the initial x-ray beam(s). Since different types of tissues (bone, air, etc.) have different attenuation coefficients, we can use the attenation of the signal to conclude what type of material we are dealing with.

**Visual appearance**  
Less dense tissue (e.g. air) --> Less attenuation --> darker appearance  
**Air is therefore black!** See long CT where a major part of the image is black.

### Problem with Radiography

We cannot differentiate between soft tissue.  

**What about Mammography, isn't it X-ray based too?**  
In breast imaging we only have soft tissue. But the higher the energy of your X-ray is, the less we are able differentiate between different tissue types. Therefore, we use low energy beams for mammography. Unfortunately, this has the affect that more radiation is absorbed by the tissue as well. This is obviously bad!

**Note:** X-Ray technology is cheap compared to other approaches.
